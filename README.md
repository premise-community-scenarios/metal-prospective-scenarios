# Prospective life cycle assessment of metals supply for the energy transition
This repository contains the code and data from my master project on the prospective life cycle assessment of metals supply for the energy transition. 
The project aimed to assess the environmental impacts associated with the production of metals needed in renewable technologies. 
The Premise library was used to generate prospective ecoinvent databases according to the results of the integrated assessment model REMIND. 
A custom scenario was created using Premise to model the evolution of secondary production in the supply of aluminum, copper, cobalt, nickel and lithium. 
The evolution of the electricity mix and the efficiency of aluminum smelters in China were also modeled.
